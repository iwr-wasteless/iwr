Incentivizing waste reduction (IWR). Seed idea: https://twitter.com/JamesCRay01/status/936992945173020672.
Quotes from [intro-v-2](https://github.com/jamesray1/iwr/edit/master/intro-v-2):

> Charge bin users or land owners for the amount of mass that they add to general waste bins.

> If there are dedicated bins for recycling, garden waste, and food waste (which
> there should be, and this program should ideally only be implemented with
> these), then there is no charge for using these. Note that rewarding users for
> these bins would incentivize excess consumption,
> or collecting biomass from forest to put in their own green waste bin.
> Have a weight machine built-in to garbage trucks, while others benefit from
> the resources collected in them, so any cost to use these bins, if any,
> should be discounted to account for such external benefits.

> The truck follows a route,
> and so can log the address of the house for each new bin unloaded into the
> truck, with the additional weight measured. Coordinates of the truck via
> GPS and mobile data
> and the timestamp at the time of loading a bin 
> can also be
> used as an extra verification. The accuracy of the weight machine
> should probably be no more than 1 gram. Using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
> to store this data has
> benefits including transparency, auditability, censorship-resistance, and
> better scalability to different councils worldwide. Making the DLT 
> Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has
> benefits including auditability and better ability to improve it or adapt it
> for other projects. 

> It is probably necessary to put locks on bins to prevent anybody from dumping
> rubbish into it and thus incurring an extra cost to the resident.
> An app for bin users would show the amounts debited with 
> each collection and the mass measured of the collected waste,
> as well as charts per month, year, and total.
> Councils could still send an invoice as per usual.
> Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
> this could be opt-in. The currency for the transactions
> should probably be the local fiat currency, represented by
> a synthetic digital token pegged to the said currency.

> People could dump waste into neighbours bins, or anywhere else other than
> their own bin. To prevent dumping into other bins, bins should have a lock
> on them. However, bins would then need to be unlocked when collecting.
> There might be ways to automate this, such as using RFID cards, but add
> complexity, costs, and would still take longer than the traditional
> collection procedure. Using a master RFID card with the truck would also
> be a security concern.
