# Introduction and Blockchain Trust Accelerator Initiative Pilot Submission Form
*Required

This is an introduction to the project, and was submitted as a 
Blockchain Trust Accelerator Initiative Pilot Submission on
Feb 22 2019. Any modifications to this form, apart from this
paragraph, will be made in a separate document.

#### What is your name? *

James Ray

#### What is the organization / entity you are affiliated with? *

It's just me at the moment, I have a startup idea.

#### What is your email address so we can reach you? *

Snip

## The Problem / Challenge:

In this section, please be prepared to explain what specific challenges you
wish to address.

#### What type of social or governance challenge are you addressing? *
- [ ] Corruption
- [ ] Economic Opportunity
- [ ] Property Rights
- [ ] Strengthening Civil Society
- [ ] Supply Chain Tracking
- [ ] Voting
- [ ] Financial Transaction
- [x] Other: Waste management

#### Are there specific aspects of the problem that you want to see addressed? *

My idea involves addressing the problem of incentivizing waste reduction.

#### Is this problem currently being addressed? If so, in what ways and to what degree of success? *

I don't think it is being addressed well because councils generally charge a
flat rate for collection. Some councils provide options of different bin
sizes, but still charge a flat rate per week in proportion to the bin's
capacity.

## The Solution and Technology

In this section, please be prepared to explain your pilot proposal in depth.

We will need to understand how your idea seeks to incorporate blockchain
technology to solve the problem(s) you described above.

#### Describe your solution. How can blockchain technology address the problem? *
Have a weight machine built-in to garbage trucks. The truck follows a route,
and so can log the address of the house for each new bin unloaded into the
truck, with the additional weight measured. The accuracy of the weight machine
should probably be no more than 1 gram. Using DLT to store this data has
benefits including transparency, auditability, censorship-resistance, and
better scalability to different councils worldwide. Making the DLT FOSS has
benefits including auditability and better ability to improve it or adapt it
for other projects. Please see
https://twitter.com/JamesCRay01/status/936992945173020672 and
https://github.com/jamesray1/iwr FMI.
The project can be adapted for stationary public bins, etc., by having an
interface that involves needing to pay to use the bin, but this would be more
complex, and would need to be not much more inconvenient than putting waste in
a bin. E.g. put it on a weight balance externally on the bin, tap a card to
pay, put it in the bin. Even this would probably be intolerable, however.
People who waste less, pay less, and people who waste more are incentivized to
waste less, or the funds collected can be spent on better waste management
technology.

#### Who are the actors involved/who is impacted by this pilot? *
Everyone that puts waste in bins and is involved with waste.

#### How many people would your solution be helping? *

Everyone that puts waste in bins and is involved with waste.

#### What steps have you taken to validate the idea/market? *

Not much as of yet.

#### How complex will the application need to be for successful functionality? *

I'm not sure if there needs to be an app for end-users. Councils could still
send an invoice. Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
this could be opt-in.

#### What challenges do you anticipate encountering were this pilot to be implemented? How can they be mitigated? *

I'm not sure if there needs to be an app for end-users. Councils could still
send an invoice. Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
this could be opt-in.

#### To what extent does your idea have the potential to be scaled? *

Theoretically it can scale worldwide, but obviously blockchains need to be
much more scalable.

## Resources
In this section, please elaborate on the state of your resources.

#### What resources have already been dedicated to the project? *

Just a small amount of my time, so far, about a day.
I don't have a lot of funds.

#### What resources do you need from the Trust Accelerator? *

I need funding, technology, expertise, and local councils to trial with.

## Working with the Trust Accelerator
#### What is the most important thing that the Trust Accelerator can do to support your work? *

- [ ] Connect with governments
- [ ] Connect with technology providers
- [x] Connect with funders
- [ ] Other:

#### How did you hear about the Trust Accelerator? *

- [ ] Media
- [x] Online research
- [ ] Recommended by colleagues
